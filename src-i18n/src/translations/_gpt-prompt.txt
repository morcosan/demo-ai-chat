I will give you the translation json for english language.
I will also give you a list of locales for the languages that I need.
I want you to create a json file for each locale that I give you.
I am using react i18n library.
{
	"key_zero": "zero",
	"key_one": "singular",
	"key_two": "two",
	"key_few": "few",
	"key_many": "many",
	"key_other": "other"
}
For each language, you must check whether the language has multiple plural forms.
If you see a key with "_other" suffix, create new keys for that translation according to i18n config.
Create new keys only if the translation is different than "_other" translation.
You must translate the json values in each language for each locale.
Use the name of the locale plus ".json" extension for file name.
Example: en-US.json
Use tabs for indenting.
Just give me the files, with no other text.
